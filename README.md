# Movie-Recommendation-System
It is developed by using pandas and cosine similarity metric.It takes input values as movie name and returns movie names which are similar to that input movie name.
It is content based recommendation system.i.e it recommends a movie to the user's based on content.
In this project we used diff lib and tfidf vectorization.
TFIDF: It is used to convert textual data into numerical features.
DIFFLIB: It is used to compare files,and produce information about file, if user enter spelling mistakes it matches close match from data.
COSINE SIMILARITY:It measures similarity between two sequences of numbers,vectors. It is measured in theta(angles).If theta is equal to 0 then they are similar and if theta is equal to 90 deg then they are disimilar.
